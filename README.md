You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The website is already deployed on Vercel. To make any changes, just commit a new version and Vercel will automatically rebuild the website. Wait like 30 seconds and you should see the new version with a confirmation email from Vercel.
